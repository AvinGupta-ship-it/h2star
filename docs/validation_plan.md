# H2STAR Validation Plan (pre-registered)

   Declared BEFORE any model output exists. Tolerances are not edited after a gate is run;
   the saved history of this file is the pre-registration record.

   ## Gate V1 — Equation of State (EOS) wrapper
   Target: my CoolProp wrapper reproduces NIST WebBook hydrogen density.
   Conditions: T = 77, 100, 160, 298 K; P = 1-200 bar (normal hydrogen).
   Pass: relative density error < 0.1% at every tabulated point.
   Rationale: both use the same reference EOS, so this tests my units/wrapper, not the physics.

   ## Gate V2 — Isotherm model
   Target: modified Dubinin-Astakhov reproduces published AX-21 excess isotherms (Richard et al. 2009).
   Pass (visual): my 77 K excess curve overlays the digitized AX-21 points with no systematic bias.
   Pass (quantitative): RMSE of excess uptake < 0.3 wt% absolute across the digitized points.
   Refit check: refitting the digitized points recovers each parameter within 20% of the paper.
   Physical check: the 77 K excess isotherm shows an interior maximum between 1 and 200 bar.

   ## Gate V3 — System model
   Target: my system GC and VC reproduce the published MOF-5 cryo-adsorbent system (HSECoE/NREL).
   Envelope: fill 77 K / 100 bar, discharge 160 K / 5 bar; 5.6 kg usable H2 basis.
   Pass: |my GC - published GC| / published GC <= 15%  AND  the same for VC.
   Rationale: system models legitimately differ in balance-of-plant detail; 15% is the agreement band.

   ## Gate V4 — Uncertainty & sensitivity machinery
   Target 1: Monte Carlo reproduces an analytic linear-Gaussian propagation within Monte Carlo error.
   Target 2: Sobol indices on the Ishigami test function match published values within 5%.
